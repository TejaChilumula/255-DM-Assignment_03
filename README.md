# 📚 Data Science Methodologies - CRISP-DM, KDD, SEMMA

### 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the enchanting world of data science methodologies! 🧙‍♂️ This repository dives deep into three major methodologies that every data wizard should know: CRISP-DM, KDD, and SEMMA. Let's set sail on this journey of structured data analysis and discovery! 🚀

### 1. 🌀 CRISP-DM: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining

CRISP-DM is like the guiding star ⭐ for data miners. It's a cyclical process that lights the way in our data journey:

1. **Business Understanding** 🏢: What are we trying to achieve? Define those goals!
2. **Data Understanding** 📊: Dive into the data ocean and get familiar with the treasures within.
3. **Data Preparation** 🧹: Time for a cleanup! Get that data shiny and ready.
4. **Modeling** 🪄: Cast your spells (algorithms) to create some magical models.
5. **Evaluation** 🎯: How did we do? Check if the magic works as expected.
6. **Deployment** 🚀: Send your magic out into the world!

### 2. 🕵️‍♂️ KDD: Knowledge Discovery in Databases

KDD is all about being a detective in the vast world of data:

1. **Selection** 📌: Choose the data mysteries you want to solve.
2. **Preprocessing** 💧: Clean and filter the data clues.
3. **Transformation** 🔀: Rearrange and reshape those clues.
4. **Data Mining** ⛏️: Dig deep and find those hidden patterns!
5. **Interpretation/Evaluation** 🧐: What did we discover? Is it valuable?

### 3. 🔍 SEMMA: Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess

SEMMA is like a telescope that helps us zoom in on the data universe:

1. **Sample** 🌌: Take a small slice of the vast data sky to examine.
2. **Explore** 🔭: Look around and understand what you're seeing.
3. **Modify** ✂️: Tweak and adjust to get a clearer view.
4. **Model** 🌠: Spot constellations (patterns) in the data stars.
5. **Assess** 📜: How clear is our view? Are we seeing things right?
